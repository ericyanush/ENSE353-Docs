The first exercise assigned for the first lab was to "build" a basic computer.

###Requirements
------------------------

The requirements to build the server box were:
1. Case with pre-installed Motherboard, power supply, and DVD drive.
2. 2GB (Maximum) of RAM
3. SATA Hard Drive
4. VGA Cable
5. Keyboard
6. Mouse
7. ATX power cable
	
###Building
----------------

To build the box, the following steps were taken:
1. The case was opened. For my case, two thumbscrews were removed and the left-side panel was slid off.
2. The RAM slots are identified on the Mainboard, and 2GB of appropriate RAM (DDR2/DDR3) was obtained, depending upon the slot type identified.
3. Install RAM in motherboard by opening ears on slot(s) and pushing RAM stick(s) into slot(s) until ears close and lock stick(s) into place.
4. Attach VGA cable to monitor on bench and box.
5. Attach ATX power cord to box, and attempt to start machine. If machine POSTs (Power On Self Test) then we have proved Motherboard, Power supply, and RAM are properly installed and functioning.
6. Disconnect power from box. 
7. Remove the hard drive mounting caddy.
8. Install hard drive into caddy.
9. Re-install hard drive caddy into case.
10. Attach power and SATA connectors from power supply and motherboard, respectively, to hard drive.
11. Attach keyboard and mouse to box.

At this point the box is completely built, and functioning, but requires an [OS (Operating System) to be installed.](OS_Install.html)
